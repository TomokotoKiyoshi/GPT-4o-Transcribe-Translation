## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Preparation

Ensure the following files and folders are present:

- `RealTime_Jp2txt.exe`: The packaged executable program: **Download from `Releases` on the right**

- `API_Key.txt`: A plain text file containing your OpenAI API Key (GPT-4o compatible)

### 2. Configure API Key

- Create a plain text file named `API_Key.txt` with **a single line** containing your valid API Key, for example:
  
  ```
  sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  ```

> ⚠️ **Do not upload or share `API_Key.txt` publicly.**

### 3. Launch the Program

- Double-click `RealTime_Jp2txt.exe` to start.

- A graphical interface will appear; no command line is required.

### 4. GUI Instructions

- **Keyword Input Box**: Optionally enter a keyword that describes the audio topic. This helps the model better understand the context.

- **Transcription Language Selection**: Choose the spoken language from the dropdown (default is Japanese). You can also select `auto` for automatic language detection.

- **Translation Language Selection**: Choose a target language for translating the transcribed text (default is English).

- **🎙️ Start Recording**: Begins real-time microphone recording. The system sends 4-second audio chunks to GPT-4o Transcribe for transcription.

- **⏹️ Stop Recording**: Immediately halts audio recording. Transcribed text remains visible.

- **🖥️ Floating Subtitles**: Opens a borderless, semi-transparent overlay window showing the two most recent lines of subtitles. It can be dragged, resized, and have its font adjusted.

- **Audio Level Bar**: Displays the current input volume level in real time.

- **Subtitle Display Area**: A scrollable area in the main window showing timestamped original and translated text in real time.
